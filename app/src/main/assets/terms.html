<p class="p2"><span class="s3">Arbitration Rules</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (the &ldquo;AAA Rules&rdquo;) then in effect, except as modified by this &ldquo;Dispute Resolution&rdquo; section. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">Arbitration Process</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA&rsquo;s roster of arbitrators.

<p class="p2"><span class="s3">Arbitration Location and Procedure</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Unless you and SpotMe otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and SpotMe submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">Arbitrator&rsquo;s Decision</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator&rsquo;s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator&rsquo;s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the &ldquo;Limitation of Liability&rdquo; section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant&rsquo;s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. SpotMe will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">Fees</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We will pay all filing and administration fees charged by the Administrator and arbitrator fees up to $1,000, and we will consider your request to pay any additional arbitration costs. If an arbitrator issues an award in our favor, you will not be required to reimburse us for any fees we have previously paid to the administrator or for which we are responsible. If you receive an award from the arbitrator, we will reimburse you for any fees paid by you to the administrator or arbitrator. Each party shall bear its own attorney's, expert's and witness fees, which shall not be considered costs of arbitration; however, if a statute gives you the right to recover these fees, or fees paid to the administrator or arbitrator, then these statutory rights will apply in arbitration.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">Changes</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Notwithstanding the provisions as regards how we can make changes to this Terms, if SpotMe changes this &ldquo;Dispute Resolution&rdquo; section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the &ldquo;Last Updated&rdquo; date above or in the date of SpotMe&rsquo;s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and SpotMe in accordance with the provisions of this &ldquo;Dispute Resolution&rdquo; section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms)</span></p>
